# Getting started

## Installation

### Basic features

Just run `npm i -g gut-flow`. You're all set!

### Shell features

Some features gut provides change the terminal's directory or maintain variables that should have the same life span
as the terminal.

It was not possible to implement those in pure NodeJS so some features are implemented in bash. You can find the list
of available shell scripts in the folder [shell](https://github.com/quilicicf/Gut/blob/master/shell).

To use these features, run `gut install` and paste the following code to your `.bashrc`:

```shell
# Installation of Gut scripts, see https://github.com/quilicicf/Gut/blob/master/specs/specs.md#shell-features
# If the link is broken, you probably want to read the README again https://github.com/quilicicf/Gut/blob/master/README.md
installGutScripts() {
  local script
  test -d ~/.config/gut && {
    while read script; do
      . "$script"
    done <<< "$(find ~/.config/gut -name '*.sh')"
  }
}
installGutScripts
```

## Initialization

### Gut configuration file

Gut keeps a configuration file in `~/.gut-config.json`. 
This file is automatically bootstrapped to a (currently fixed) value at startup if it is not found.

Contents of the file:

```json
{
  "username": "Your git username",
  "repositoriesPath": "The path to your folder containing git repositories. Yes it's assumed all are in one place!",
  "preferredGitServer": "The git server you are using"
}
```

For `preferredGitServer` the only accepted value at the time is github. Other servers will be added as well as the 
possibility to configure yours in the future.

### Repository configuration file

Gut will search for a file named `.gut-config.json` at the root of your repositories to retrieve the 
repository-specific configuration.

Contents of the file: 

```json
{
  "commitMessageSuffixTemplate": "Template of the suffix that should be added to your commit messages"
}
```

- `commitMessageSuffixTemplate`: when committing on a branch that contains a ticket number, gut will look for the 
suffix template. If a suffix is found, the template will be used to suffix the commit message, replacing 
`$ticketNumber` with the actual ticket number, retrieved from the branch name (see [branch naming](#branch-naming)).

## Spirit of the git flow

### Organization of your repositories

It is assumed you'll keep all your repositories into a single folder, which will be named __forge__ in the rest of 
this document and is structured like the following.

```
forge
├── github
│   ├── owner1
│   │   ├── repo1
│   │   └── repo2
│   └── owner2
│       ├── repo1
│       └── repo2
└── gitlab
    ├── owner1
    │   ├── repo1
    │   └── repo2
    └── owner2
        ├── repo1
        └── repo2

```

### Git branching

#### Branch flow

Branch types:
- __Master:__ The branch `master` is a branch that strictly follows the production. It is therefore a faithful 
representation of what's in production at ANY MOMENT
- __Version branches:__ When starting the development of a version, a branch is created from master.
- __Feature branches:__ A version can contain multiple features. In case two or more developers work on a feature, they 
can create a branch from the version branch. To allow for scope adjustment, the feature can be merged in the next 
version if need be.
- __Dev branches:__ When working on a ticket, a dev creates a branch from the feature or version branch.

The following rules apply to the branches: 
1. It is allowed to force-push on branches that are only used by a single developer (to create a clean history).
1. As soon as two developers start working on the same branch, force-push is prohibited (I'll implement safe-guards but 
that's a little further down the roadmap).
1. To have a clean history, the rebase is preferred to update the version/feature/dev branches to the last modifications. 
They should be done when there's the fewest branches open and the branch that's to be rebased must be duplicated 
first of course (there'll be tooling down the roadmap for that too).
1. The rebase-and-merge feature is to be preferred when merging branches down.
1. Delivery to the QA team is done y creating a tag named as a time stamp (ISO 8601)
1. When the QA validates a tag, it is merged into master, then production tag is created and named `v<full version>`

Benefits of this flow:
- there is a branch that follows the production so it's easy to know what's in prod and debug it
- the history is linear and really easy to read
- forgetting to merge something seldom happens
- even if the rebase was not done on alive branches after a merge to master, there should never be devs lost in 
translation

Attention points:
- the tag that goes to production is not exactly the tag validated by the QA. If the merge is not smooth, the QA
might need to re-check things
- when a tag is merged into production, all live branches must be rebased

#### Branch naming

- Version branches: `<major version>.<minor version>.<patch version>` ex: `2.3.19`
- Feature branches: `<full version>_<feature>` ex: `2.3.19_whatsNewDialog`
- Dev branches: `<full version>_<feature>_<ticket number>_<dev>` ex: `2.3.19_whatsNewDialog_8495_optOut` or if
there's no feature branch `2.3.19_456_noLogsBug`

Benefits of this naming:
- No need to look at the commit tree to find where a dev started
- Easy to spot if a branch is not rebased to the right origin (merging `1.2.2_123_totoFeature` in `1.3.0` should
raise an alarm in your head)
- Easy to clean the old local branches, just filter them with regex (there's gonna be a utility for that)
- Easy to interact with CI/CD, the branch is parsable, the ticket number easy to retrieve

#### Commit messages format

Commit messages should be suffixed with the ticket number so that your bug tracker/CI/CD can track them and associate
 the commit to the ticket.

In GitHub, you can suffix your commit message with `#<ticket number>` and GitHub will reference the commit in the
 issue.

In JIRA, you can suffix the commit message with `(<project id>-<ticket number>)` to get the same result.

# Git features

## Audit

Usage: `gut audit`.

Inspects a git diff and displays a summary. Displayed items are:
* Lines added/removed
* Oddities found in the added code
  * TODO
  * FIXME
  * Abusive printing (console.log in JS, System.out.print in Java)
  * Local paths (looks for your home directory)

Arguments:
* `-n` inspect the n last commits (exclusive with -f and -t)
* `-f` the commit from which to start the diff
* `-t` the commit where the diff ends

Example output:

![Inspect output](./images/audit_output.png)

## Divisions

Usage: `gut divisions -r o`.

Displays the branches on a specific remote. The parameter r is the name of the remote or all to show all branches.
There are a few shortcuts to go faster:
- a stands for all
- l stands for local
- o stands for origin
- u stands for upstream

If the parameter is omitted, only the local branches are shown.

## Execute

Usage: `gut execute -m <message>`.

Creates a commit with the provided message.

Arguments:
* `-m`: The commit message. It will be automatically suffixed with the ticket number if available (in the branch name)
and the repository is configured (see [Repository configuration file](#repository-configuration-file))
with `commitMessageSuffixTemplate`. The commit message is an array, you don't need to quote it (see examples).
* `-c`: Creates a code review commit, the message is set to `:eyes: Code review`, suffixed with the ticket number if
applicable. Mutually exclusive with `-m`

Examples:
* `gut execute -m :memo: Specify better commit messages` will create a commit with a message set to
`:memo: Specify better commit messages`. Note: you will need to quote it if you have a word that begin with `-` in the
commit message, otherwise it will be seen as a parameter to the gut command.
* `gut execute -m ':memo: Specify better commit messages'` will create a commit with a message set to
`:memo: Specify better commit messages`.
* `gut execute -c`will create a commit with a message set to `:eyes: Code review`.

The commit should fail if the user has unstaged changes.

## History

Usage: `gut history`.

Displays commits history (equivalent to `git log`).

Arguments:
* `-f` format, the format in the list of predefined formats (see list below, defaults to `pretty`)
* `-s` skip the n first commits in the history (defaults to 0)
* `-n` shows only n commits (default to 100)
* `-r` reverses the order in which the commits are shown. If not specified, the commits will be displayed from newest
 to oldest.

Available formats:
* `pretty`: a colored and well indented format, see screenshot below
* `json`: the commits are returned as a JSON array
* `sha`:  only the shas are returned. Very useful when used with reverse to cherry-pick a few commits!

Log format `pretty`:

![Log format pretty](./images/log_pretty.png)

## Obliterate

Usage: `gut obliterate -b master_deleteSpec -r o`

Deletes an item on the specified remote. Can delete branches and tags.

Arguments:
  * `-r` The remote where the item should be deleted, defaults to `local`. Can be:
    * local: if not defined or in `['l', 'local']`)
    * origin: if in `['o', 'origin']`
    * upstream: if in `['u', 'upstream']`
  * `-b` The name of the branch to delete. Exclusive with `-t`
  * `-t` The name of the tag to delete. Exclusive with `-b`

Examples:
  * `gut obliterate -b master_deleteSpec`: deletes the branch `master_deleteSpec` locally.
  Literally does `git branch -D master_deleteSpec`
  * `gut obliterate -t v1.2.3 -r o` deletes the tag `v1.2.3` on `origin`.
  Literally does `git push --delete origin v1.2.3`

## Pile

Usage: `gut pile`.

Adds all the changes in the repository. Literally does `git add <repository top level> -A`.

## Pushb popb

Usage: `pushb <branch name>; do things; popb`

Works like pushd and popd but for GitHub branches.

> Note: This feature is implemented in bash, it requires some specific [installation steps](#shell-features).

## Replicate

Usage: `gut replicate -s server -o owner -r repo`.

Clones the repository in `<forge>/<server>/<owner>/<repo>`.

If you omit the server, the `preferredGitServer` from your [configuration file](#configuration-file) will be used.
If you omit the owner, the `username` from your [configuration file](#configuration-file) will be used.

## Switch

Usage: `gut switch -t <target branch>`.

Checks out a branch. You can create the branch and check it out in a single command.

Arguments:
- `-t` target branch, if it exists
- `-r` regex to be used to search for the branch to check out
- `-v` create a new version branch, the value of the parameter is the version (follows semver). You can only create a
version branch from master.
- `-f` create a new feature branch, the value of the parameter is the feature's description. It can't contain an
underscore. You can only create a feature branch from master or a version branch.
- `-i` only usable with `-f`. Is set, the feature branch will be built each time your commit on the branch.
- `-d` create a new dev branch, the value of the parameter is the dev's description. It can't contain an underscore.
You can create dev branches from every type of branches but dev branches.
- `-n` only usable with `-d`. The ticket number associated with the dev.

Examples:
- `gut switch -t master` switches to branch `master`
- `gut switch -r 2345` would match branch `9.1.6_2345_myDev` and check it out if it were the only match
- `gut switch -v 2.35.9` (called from `master`) creates a version branch named `2.35.9`
- `gut switch -f myFeature -i` (called from `2.35.9`) creates a feature branch named `2.35.9_build#myFeature`
- `gut switch -d myDev -n 123` (called from `2.35.9_build#myFeature`) creates a dev branch named
`2.35.9_build#myFeature_123_myDev`

## Thrust

Usage: `gut thrust`.

Pushes changes to the remote and sets the branches upstream to `<remote>/<branchName>`.
The user can always change the remote to push to but he must do it the first time he pushes a branch if there's more
than one remote configured.

Arguments:
* `-r` remote, the remote to push to
