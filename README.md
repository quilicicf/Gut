## Getting started

The whole project is specified in the [specs document](./specs/specs.md).
From installation to commands and git flow explanation, you should find everything there.
If something's amiss, please create an issue.

## Contributing

There's a killer feature missing? A bug found a way in? The documentation is insufficient?
Any contribution is welcome, please get a look at
[my contribution guidelines](https://github.com/quilicicf/Docs/blob/master/contribution/main.md).

For the more code-specific things:

1. Git
    1. Create an issue on this repository so we can discuss your contribution
    1. Fork this repository
    1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master` and named following the
    [branch naming convention](./specs/specs.md#branch-naming)
    1. Commit and push the topic branch
    1. Every behaviour modification should be reported in the specs, you can ask me to do that if you find it boring
    though
    1. Make a pull request
1. Code style
    1. Please configure your IDE to use the `.eslintrc` file for formatting
    1. Please favor immutable variables and pure functions where applicable
1. Other
    1. Always let me know by issue before contributing so that we don't work on the same topic and waste time
    1. You don't know how or don't have the time to contribute? Sharing your ideas in issues is already contributing
    and appreciated!
